    <h2> About Me </h2>
     <p>My name is Navya Bhardwaj. Being a highly self-motivated individual, I often cling to my goals until I achieve them. 
        I completed my matriculation from St. Joseph Convent School, Jalandhar. This school has played a detrimental role in shaping me as a confident woman.
        I got 95.67% in my boards of Class 12th. 
        I am currently in Class 12th of Delhi Public School which is a CBSE affiliated school.
        My interests lie in Coding, Sports and Music. </p>
    


    <h2> TheNavyaBhardwajBlog </h2>
    I started this blog because writing is a an amazing outlet of my thoughts. after I pen down my thoughts, my head seems lighter and less crowded.
    By far i have written 3 Blogs. Not to brag, but they are a must read. ;)

    I also have an Instagram page by the same name. Although i started out by posting about my take on a few books.
    But I figured that people don't need that right now. In these challenging times, I need to do something that helps them.
    So, i started posting Motivational content which makes people feel good about themselves. 
    Check it out and let me know if i did a good job there. :)
